# 🐛 debug-this-if-you-can

Welcome to a multi-faceted playground of code, thoughts, and challenges - all under one roof.

This repository (repo) is a bit like my coding journal, toolbox, and playground rolled into one. It contains:

- 📓 [**it-worked-on-my-machine**](https://github.com/minh1505/debug-this-if-you-can/tree/main/it-worked-on-my-machine)
  My personal takes, experiences, and opinions on coding topics and best practices.

- 🛠️  [**modern-cpp-notes**](https://github.com/minh1505/debug-this-if-you-can/tree/main/modern-cpp-notes)
  Notes and tips on modern C++ features, idioms, and best practices.

- 🎯 [**coding-platforms**](https://github.com/minh1505/debug-this-if-you-can/tree/main/coding-platforms)
  My solutions to problems from popular coding challenge sites like LeetCode, CodinGame, and more.

## Why this repo?

Because coding is more than just writing code: it’s about **learning**, **experimenting**, **sharing**, and sometimes **debugging** mysteries.

Whether you are here to read my thoughts, learn modern ```C++```, or check out problem solutions, there is something for every curious coder.

Pull up a terminal 💻, make a matcha 🍵 (with or without almond milk 🥜🥛), and enjoy the journey. 🚀

*Happy coding!*
