# 🐛 debug-this-if-you-can

Welcome to a multi-faceted playground of code, thoughts, and challenges — all under one roof.

This repo is a bit like my coding journal, toolbox, and playground rolled into one. It contains:

- 📓 **it-worked-on-my-machine**  
  My personal takes, experiences, and opinions on coding topics and best practices.

- 🛠️ **modern-cpp-notes**  
  Notes and tips on modern C++ features, idioms, and best practices.

- 🎯 **coding-platforms**  
  My solutions to problems from popular coding challenge sites like LeetCode, CodinGame, and more.

## Why this repo?

Because coding is more than just writing code — it’s about learning, experimenting, sharing, and sometimes debugging mysteries.

Whether you're here to read my thoughts, learn modern C++, or check out problem solutions, there’s something for every curious coder.
