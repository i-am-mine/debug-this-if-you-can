# 🎯 Coding platforms

Welcome to my personal **arena of algorithms** — a collection of coding problems I’ve solved across various platforms, including:

- 🧩 LeetCode  
- 🎮 CodinGame  
- 📘 HackerRank  
- 🧠 Codeforces  
- ✍️ AtCoder  
- ...and more

Each subfolder is dedicated to a specific platform, with my solutions and notes for individual problems.

## 🛠 Why This Folder Exists

Practicing on different platforms helps sharpen problem-solving skills, exposes me to a variety of patterns, and keeps things interesting. This folder serves as:

- A **record** of my learning and growth  
- A **reference** for tricky problems I’ve solved  
- A **toolkit** I can revisit when preparing for interviews or contests

## 🧪 How I Work

For many problems, I try to write solutions in **C**, **C++**, and **Python**, each with its own perspective and style.  
Then, I upload them to my **website**, along with:

- ✨ A clear explanation of the **solution idea**
- 🧮 **Time and space complexity** analysis
- 🔁 Comparisons between different approaches
- 💬 Occasionally, my opinion on which one is more **elegant**, **efficient**, or just **fun to implement**

It’s not just about solving problems — it’s about understanding them deeply and enjoying the process.

## 📚 What's Inside

- ✅ My accepted solutions  
- 💡 Notes or observations where relevant  
- 🔍 Alternate implementations (if I felt like experimenting)

---

## 🚧 Note

This isn’t a polished showcase — it’s a **learning log**. Some solutions are clean and quick, others may be messy. That’s all part of the journey.

Feel free to explore. And if you spot something weird, confusing, or clever — awesome! That’s the point.
