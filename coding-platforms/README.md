# 🎯 Coding platforms

Welcome to my personal **arena of algorithms**, a collection of coding problems I have solved across various platforms, including:

- 🧩 LeetCode  
- 🎮 CodinGame  
- 📘 HackerRank

Each subfolder is dedicated to a specific platform, with my solutions and notes for individual problems.

## 🛠 Why This Folder Exists

Practicing on different platforms helps sharpen problem-solving skills, exposes me to a variety of patterns, and keeps things interesting. This folder serves as:

- A record of my learning and growth  
- A reference for tricky problems I have solved  
- A toolkit I can revisit when preparing for interviews or contests

## 🧪 How I Work

For many problems, I try to write solutions in C, C++, and Python, each offering its own perspective and style. Then, I upload them here along with analysis (I will try to complete all of them unless I get lazy 😅):

- ✨ A clear explanation of the solution idea.
- 🧮 Time and space complexity analysis.
- 🔁 Comparisons between different approaches.
- 💬 Occasionally, my opinion on which one is more elegant, efficient, or just fun to implement.

It is not just about solving problems, it’s about understanding them deeply and enjoying the process.

## 🚧 Note

This is not a polished showcase, it is a learning log. Some solutions are clean and quick, others may be messy and chaotic. That is part of the journey that I absolutely do not want to skip any part of it.

Feel free to explore. And if you spot something weird, confusing, or clever. That is the point.
