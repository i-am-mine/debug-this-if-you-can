# 001. Two Sum

## 🔍 Idea

Use a hashmap to store complements. When a match is found, return the indices.

## ⏱️ Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## 💬 My Thoughts

This problem is perfect for showing how handy hashmaps are. I like the clean C++ STL use — Python is concise too, but C is clunky for this kind of mapping.
