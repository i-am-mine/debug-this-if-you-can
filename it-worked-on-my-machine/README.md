# it-worked-on-my-machine 🧪🖥️

Welcome to my digital cave of code thoughts — a place where things **worked on my machine**, and maybe (just maybe) they will work on yours too.

## 🧠 What is this repo?

This is my ongoing, unapologetically opinionated collection of:

- 📝 **Things I’ve learned** through practice, error messages, Stack Overflow rabbit holes, and hard-won victories.
- 💬 **Opinions** based on real-world experience — no theory without keyboard bruises.
- 🤯 **Ideas** — some thoughtful, some bizarre, all worth exploring (at least once).

I use this space to:
- Reflect on coding habits and lessons
- Write mini-essays or dev logs
- Brain-dump potential project or feature ideas
- Track my evolution as a developer

## ✍️ Why the name?

Because half of the stuff here probably:
- Was fixed by a desperate `printf("why\n")`, or `cout << "What is happening?"` followed by a matcha (with milk or not, better with almond flavor)
- Broke right after I committed it
- Only worked after a magical incantation and matcha

...but hey, it worked **on my machine**. 😎

## 📚 Topics I’ll Cover

- Dev logs and "a-ha!" moments
- Opinions on tools, languages, practices
- Theories and patterns I’m testing in real projects
- Sketchy but possibly brilliant ideas
- Mistakes I’ve made (and learned from)
- Bonus: The occasional meme reference

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- Some content may age like wine. Some like milk. (Did you get this? 😎)
- All code is tested on **my machine**. No refunds.

Pull up a terminal, sip some matcha (milk optional, almond flavor recommended), and enjoy the journey. 🚀
