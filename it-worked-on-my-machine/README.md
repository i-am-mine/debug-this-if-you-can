# it-worked-on-my-machine 🧪🖥️

Welcome to my digital cave of code thoughts — a place where things **worked on my machine**, and maybe (just maybe) they will work on yours too.

## 🧠 What is this reposition?

This is my ongoing and unapologetically opinionated collection of:

- 📝 **Things I have learned**: through practice, error messages, and hard-won victories.
- 💬 **Opinions**: based on real-world experience, no theory without keyboard bruises.
- 🤯 **Ideas**: some thoughtful, some bizarre, all worth exploring (at least once).

I use this space to:
- Reflect on coding habits and lessons.
- Write mini-essays or dev logs.
- Brain-dump potential project or feature ideas.
- Track my evolution as a developer.

## ✍️ Why the name?

Because half of the stuff here probably:
- Was fixed by a desperate ```printf("why\n");```, or ```cout << "What is happening?";``` followed by a matcha (with milk or not, better with almond flavor).
- Broke right after I committed it.
- Only worked after a magical incantation and matcha.

...but hey, it worked **on my machine**. 😎

## 📚 Topics I will Cover

- Dev logs and "a-ha!" moments.
- Opinions on tools, languages, practices.
    - [memory-speed-tradeoff](https://github.com/minh1505/debug-this-if-you-can/tree/main/it-worked-on-my-machine/memory-speed-tradeoff)
- Theories and patterns I am testing in real projects.
- Sketchy but possibly brilliant ideas.
- Mistakes I have made (and learned from).
- Bonus: The occasional meme reference.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- Some content may age like wine. Some like milk. (Did you get this? 😎)
- All code is tested on **my machine**. No refunds.

Open a terminal 💻, sip some matcha 🍵 (milk optional 🥛, almond flavor recommended 🥜), and enjoy the journey 🚀.
