## Potential ideas

- New repo: some tips to optimize time
	- Use math
	- Consider special/edge cases to reduce case execution: [prob1](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-valid-string/problem?isFullScreen=true)

- Game theory
	- Generalize and guess the frequence of results => design an algo
	- Very simple math algo, but how can we realize the periodic rules (if existing!) in a short time (for interview): [prob1](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/description/)
