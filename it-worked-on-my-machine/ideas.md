## Potential ideas

- New folder: some terminologies should be known, not a must-have, but good-to-have / should-have
	- Anagram (use hashtable, set, ...)
	- Palindrome
	- Kaprekar number


- New folder: some tips to optimize time
	- Use math:
		- Add wonderful formula very useful
	- Consider special/edge cases to reduce case execution: [prob1](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-valid-string/problem?isFullScreen=true)

- Game theory
	- Generalize and guess the frequence of results => design an algo
	- Very simple math algo, but how can we realize the periodic rules (if existing!) in a short time (for interview): [prob1](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/description/)
